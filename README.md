Google Play Games Extension v1.0.2

This is a Marmalade extension that implements an Android interface to Google Play Games. 

Google site links:
https://developers.google.com/games/services/ - contains all the Google documentation.

The extension is built against Google Play Services revision 7 and the BaseGameActivity class from the Android samples dated April 18th 2013. Using Marmalade 6.2.2. GooglePlayGames and requires a minimum of Android SDK 13 (Android 3.2 Honeycomb).

The extension only supports Leaderboards and Achievements at this time, though adding more functionality should be easy enough.

I have included a buildable sample including keys – however only Google Plus accounts whitelisted in my console will be able to interact with it. You will need to change the settings and configure your own application. You can use my private keys for convenience if you prefer though must replace with your own if releasing,.

Any problems please email me – dhunt.home@gmail.com .(It was a bit of a pig to get working as you may be able to tell from the length of the instructions below – apologies in advance I hope the process will be more streamlined in the future)
